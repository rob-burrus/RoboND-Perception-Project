# 3D Perception

Implementation of 3D perception pipeline for a simulated PR-2 robot with RGB-D camera with sensor noise and lens distortion. Filtering, object segmentation, object recognition, and pose estimation techniques are applied to allow the PR-2 to pick up target objects in a cluttered environment. 

## Perception Pipeline

### Statistical outlier Filtering and RANSAC plane fitting

### Cluster Segmentation

### Object recognition - feature extraction and SVM training

## Pick and Place Setup

## Results and Analysis
